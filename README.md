# NewsHUB

NewsHUB is a Flask-based web application that allows users to search for news articles by keyword, view article summaries generated by AI, and share articles across social media platforms. It leverages the NewsAPI for fetching news, uses NLP models for summarization, and provides a clean, modern UI.

## Features
- **Keyword-based News Search:** Search for the latest news articles using any keyword.
- **AI-Powered Summarization:** Summarize articles using state-of-the-art NLP models (T5 or BART via HuggingFace Transformers).
- **Article Extraction:** Robust extraction of article content from URLs using multiple fallback methods.
- **Social Sharing:** Generate shareable links for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Email.
- **Responsive UI:** Modern interface with static assets (CSS, JS, logo).

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- See `requirements.txt` for all dependencies.

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd NewsHUB
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:
     ```env
     FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
     ```
   - Get your NewsAPI key from [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/)

4. **Run the app:**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## File Structure
```
app.py                # Main Flask application
requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
static/               # Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
  ├── logo.png
  ├── style.css
  └── js/
      └── main.js
templates/            # HTML templates
  ├── index.html
  └── share.html
```

## Usage
- Enter a keyword on the homepage to search for news articles.
- Click "Summarize" to generate an AI summary of any article.
- Use the share buttons to share articles on social media or via email.

## Notes
- Summarization uses HuggingFace Transformers (T5 or BART). The first run may take longer due to model download.
- Article extraction uses `newspaper3k` and BeautifulSoup for robustness.
- If the NewsAPI quota is exceeded or unavailable, the app will handle errors gracefully.
